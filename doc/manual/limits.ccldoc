(chapter "Implementation Limits"

"Fixnums on 32-bit systems are 30 bits long, and cover the interval
 (-536870912, 536870911).  Fixnums on 64-bit systems are 61 bits
 long, and cover the interval (-1152921504606846976, 1152921504606846975)
 (see {section Tagging scheme}).

 Internal time is represented in nanoseconds, and
 {variable internal-time-units-per-second} is 1000000000."
